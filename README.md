# Concept
Create a decentralized Mesh network for people in The Netherlands, to use internet-like services, without an ISP.

# This repository
Use this repository to create concepts and plans for networking and hardware. PRs welcome/

# History
This project grew from the [De Bitcoin Mesh](https://t.me/DeBitcoinMesh) chat. 
Most people in this group would like to use the mesh for using Bitcoin, but the plans are broader now.
